Abnormal event detection, human behaviour detection, as well as object recognition plays a vital role 
in the creation of a smart CCTV system. These systems make it possible to detect abnormal events 
in an environment, abnormal behaviours by humans and the state of alert in the environment. 
Machine Vision property along with Machine Learning are used in these systems to detect as well as 
identify the particular anomalies that arise in the video feed from the CCTV. Frame by frame 
processing is commonly used and Supervised Learning is the commonly used training method for 
these systems. However, since the anomalies are of many different kinds and also because it is not 
feasible to pre-detect and train all types of anomalies, supervised learning is being replaced by 
unsupervised learning and semi - supervised learning for training the system. This system provides 
a means of minimising or removing the human workload that has to be put on to manually detect and 
create an alert on detection of an abnormality in the live feed provided by the CCTV. Also the system 
increases the storage efficiency by storing only the abnormal events in original quality and storing 
the normal scenarios in low quality for archiving. Also this system provides an extension of creating 
a distributed abnormality classification system, where only the abnormal events are sent on to 
different dedicated systems to classify the abnormality.
